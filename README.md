This is a project for Software Design & Construction at the University of Central Arkansas

The purpose of this project is to study the use of Maven for dependency management and packaging.

In this project, I tried to develop a reusable foundation for creating simple 2D games using the LibGDX framework.

It's currently in a very early stage. The game itself is only meant to be test the systems, but will updated as the project develops. 

The project can be built by cloning the respository and running `mvn clean package` in the terminal.

This will create an executable Jar file. However, this may require the most recent version of the Oracle JRE to run and has not been tested on Windows systems yet.
