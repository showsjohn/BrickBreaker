This is a project for Software Design & Construction at the University of Central Arkansas

The purpose of this project is to study the use of Gradle for dependency management and packaging.

In this project, I tried to develop a reusable foundation for creating simple 2D games using the LibGDX framework.

It's currently in a very early stage. The game itself is only meant to be test the systems, but will updated as the project develops. 

The project can be built by cloning this repository and running: For Linux: `./gradlew shadowJar` | For Windows: `gradlew.bat shadowJar` in the root of the project directory.

This will generate a runnable .Jar file in the BrickBreacker/build/libs/ directory. To run this file, simply use `java -jar build/libs/BoxBreaker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
